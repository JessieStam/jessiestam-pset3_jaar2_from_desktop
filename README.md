**Watch List**

*By Jessie Stam*

This application allow the user to search for films online and to add them to a list of films they still want to see. It firsts promts
the user for a title, then looks for information using that title, displaying it on the screen. With the push of a button the user can 
add this film to the list of film he yet wants to see, or he can push the backbutton to leave the information page. Each film in the list
can be clicked to change its color - watched movies can be easily distinguished from movies that have not yet been watched.
To create the list a recyclerview is used that is updated by the corresponding adapter class. Internet connection is provided by the
HttpRequestHelper class.
